# License Tracker

<h2>Back End Team!</h2>
<p> This was one of the first team projects I workked on as a web developer. I got to work mostly on the bak end. 
we used Firerebase, Javascript, APIs such as a bing search API and SMTPjs API we built an app to track licenses and send a reminder to renew them.</p>
